Walk on sidewalks whenever they are available.
Cross streets at crosswalks or intersections where drivers expect pedestrians.
Do not walk between cars when they are stopped at traffic lights.
Be extra cautious around construction zones.
Be alert and aware of your surroundings including oncoming traffic, bicycles and other pedestrians.
Be visible to drivers when crossing the street. Make eye contact with drivers to ensure that they have seen you.
Heading to class or a campus building on our Sir George Williams campus? Please consider taking the underground tunnel which connects the Hall, Library, GM, EV and MB buildings – this remains a very safe option for pedestrian travel.

In 2022, 79 pedestrians lost their lives in Quebec road accidents! Let’s work together to keep our community safe.

2023-06-06,,Saturday shutdown of EV and LB buildings due to city infrastructure work,"['EV', 'LB']",[],[],[],,,,,,"
Two major Concordia buildings will be closed on Saturday, June 10, 2023. The Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (EV) and the W.J. McConnell Building (LB) will be closed as of 7 a.m. They will reopen after the City of Montreal has completed infrastructure work, slated to last most of the day.
The closure is necessary because there will be no municipal water going to the two Concordia buildings, something which impacts washrooms and other key facilities. As a result, only those who have obtained permission to be in the buildings or have an emergency need will be granted access. They will also have to show a piece of valid Concordia I.D.
Those who need to access the Guy-De Maisonneuve Building can still do so on Saturday but they will not be able to transit through the EV Building during the closure.
Once the city work has been completed and building infrastructure verified by Concordia, the EV and LB will reopen. However, because the city cannot yet provide an approximate time, community members should avoid the two buildings until Sunday morning.
For questions or concerns, please email facilities@concordia.ca

Deux pavillons importants de Concordia seront fermés le samedi 10 juin 2023 à compter de 7 h : le pavillon intégré Génie, informatique et arts visuels (EV) et le pavillon J.-W.-McConnell (LB). Les travaux d’infrastructure de la ville devraient durer une grande partie de la journée. Une fois ceux-ci terminés, l’Université rouvrira les deux pavillons.
La fermeture des deux pavillons de Concordia est nécessaire parce que l’alimentation en eau y sera complètement interrompue, ce qui aura une incidence sur les salles de bain et d’autres installations importantes. Par conséquent, l’accès sera réservé aux personnes ayant obtenu l’autorisation nécessaire ou se trouvant en situation d’urgence. Ces personnes devront présenter une carte d’identité valide de Concordia.
Le pavillon Guy-De Maisonneuve demeurera accessible samedi, mais il sera impossible d’y accéder en passant par le pavillon EV.
Une fois les travaux de la ville terminés et l’infrastructure des bâtiments vérifiée par Concordia, les pavillons EV et LB rouvriront leurs portes. Toutefois, étant donné que les autorités municipales ne sont pas encore en mesure d’indiquer à quel moment les travaux prendront fin, les membres de la communauté sont priés d’attendre à dimanche matin avant de tenter d’accéder de nouveau aux deux immeubles.

Les travaux de remplacement des portes et de rénovation des entrées de l'édifice John-Molson (MB) sont entrés dans une nouvelle phase. Avec la réouverture du vestibule nord, les améliorations aux portes sud débutent le 21 février 2023.
L'entrée du vestibule sud, située sur la rue Guy, près de la ruelle, sera fermée pendant environ six mois. Pendant cette période, les membres de la communauté pourront utiliser les nouvelles portes, plus grandes, situées à l'angle des rues Guy et De Maisonneuve. Ils pourront également entrer dans le bâtiment à partir du tunnel du niveau du métro.

2022-10-24,,Un projet d’infrastructure entraîne la fermeture temporaire de l’entrée du pavillon AD ainsi que des coupures d’eau,['AD'],[],[],[],,,,,,"
L’entrée pour les véhicules et les piétons souhaitant accéder au pavillon de l’administration (AD) du campus Loyola sera modifiée pendant au moins deux semaines, du lundi 24 octobre au vendredi 4 novembre 2022. L’accès au pavillon n’en sera pas affecté.
Cette modification d’accès à l’entrée est nécessaire pour mener des travaux d’infrastructure sur le conduit d’eau principal du campus Loyola. Ces travaux sont requis par la ville de Montréal dans le cadre de ses efforts visant à installer des compteurs d’eau dans tous les bâtiments institutionnels de la ville.
De plus, à deux reprises, les occupants de certains édifices ne pourront pas boire l’eau du robinet jusqu’à ce que les tests de qualité soient concluants.
Impact de l’accès limité pour les piétons et les cyclistes
Les cyclistes et les piétons pourront accéder au pavillon AD et aux bâtiments avoisinants en passant par les trottoirs de la rue Sherbrooke, à l’est ou à l’ouest des travaux. Les personnes qui empruntent la navette devraient aussi pouvoir utiliser ces passages sans problème.
Les automobilistes qui déposent quelqu’un pourront le faire à l’ouest du chantier, le long de la rue Sherbrooke, or par Refectory Road (chemin du réfectoire), à partir de la rue West Broadway.
Les espaces de stationnement demeureront accessibles par Refectory Road, y compris les espaces réservés aux personnes en situation de handicap.
Renseignements complémentaires sur l’accessibilité

Les deux espaces réservés aux personnes en situation de handicap en face du pavillon AD ne seront pas accessibles durant les travaux.
Les chemins longeant les deux côtés de l’espace fermé sont pavés.
Une zone de dépose-minute est située à l’ouest de l’espace fermé; vous la trouverez au moyen des panneaux de signalisation municipale.
Les personnes ayant des besoins en matière d’accessibilité préféreront peut-être accéder au campus par Refectory Road et l’entrée située à l’arrière du complexe des sciences Richard‑J.‑Renaud (SP). 
La zone de dépose-minute pour les véhicules de transport adapté de la STM sera temporairement déplacée à l’arrière du pavillon AD, accessible par Refectory Road

Impact sur l’eau dans certains bâtiments
Au début et à la fin du projet, il y aura de courtes périodes de coupure d’eau, et des périodes un peu plus longues durant lesquelles l’eau ne devra pas être consommée.
Du 25 octobre à 23 h au 26 octobre à 7 h, l’eau sera coupée dans les bâtiments suivants :

AD (pavillon de l’administration)
CC (pavillon central)
RF (Centre des congrès des Jésuites de Loyola)
PY (pavillon de psychologie)
PS (pavillon du Service des terrains et des bâtiments)
 FC (pavillon F.-C.-Smith/chapelle)

Ces coupures concernent l’eau chaude et froide domestique ainsi que les toilettes.
Après chaque coupure, les occupants des édifices ci-dessus NE DEVRONT PAS boire l’eau du robinet. Les fontaines et stations de remplissage de bouteille seront fermées, et une signalisation indiquera où trouver de l’eau potable dans les autres bâtiments.
Cette restriction liée à l’eau permettra de procéder à des tests pour s’assurer que la qualité de l’eau respecte à nouveau les normes pertinentes après les travaux.
Les toilettes demeureront accessibles et les lavabos pourront être utilisés pour le lavage des mains et de la vaisselle. Les occupants qui remarquent un changement de couleur de l’eau devront la faire couler jusqu’à ce qu’elle soit à nouveau claire.
Intensité du bruit et risques de retard
La période de travaux la plus intense en matière de bruit devrait être durant les deux premiers jours du projet en raison de l’excavation. Si le temps est clément, ces deux jours devraient être les 24 et 25 octobre.
En cas de retard lié à l’équipement ou aux intempéries, le projet pourrait être prolongé au-delà de la période de deux semaines.

2022-10-19,,Infrastructure project leads to temporary closure of AD entranceway and water interruptions,['AD'],[],['entrance'],[],,,,,,"
Vehicle and pedestrian access to the entrance area of Loyola’s Administration Building (AD) will be detoured for at least two weeks, from Monday, October 24 to Friday, November 4, 2022. Access to the building itself will not be affected.
The entranceway detour is due to infrastructure work on the main water conduit to Loyola Campus. It is required by the City of Montreal as part of efforts to install water meters on all institutional buildings in the city. 
There will also be two periods when the occupants of certain buildings will not be able to drink tap water until testing is completed.
Limited access impact for pedestrians and cyclists
Cyclists and pedestrians may access AD and its surrounding buildings by one of the sidewalks from Sherbrooke, east or west of the work. Those getting on or off the shuttle bus should also be able to do so unincumbered. 
As for drivers, those dropping people off can do so west of the worksite, along Sherbrooke, or via Rectory Road, off West Broadway. 
Access to parking spaces remains available from Refectory Road, including spaces reserved for people with disabilities.
Additional accessibility information

The two spaces reserved for those with disabilities in front of AD will be inaccessible during the work.
Paths on either side of the closed area are paved.
On the west side of the closed area is a drop-off zone, identified with municipal signage.
Those with accessibility needs may prefer to access campus from Refectory Road and the rear entrance of the Richard J. Renaud Science Complex (SP).
The STM adapted transport drop-off will be temporarily relocated to the back of the AD, accessible by Refectory Road.

Impacts on water in certain buildings 
At the beginning and end of the project, there will be short periods when water will be shut off, and slightly longer ones when people should not drink the water.
From 11 p.m. on October 25 to 7 a.m. on October 26, water will be shut off in: 

AD (Administration Building)
CC (Central Building)
RF (Jesuit Hall and Conference Center)
PY (Psychology Building)
PS (Physical Services Building)
FC (Smith Building/Chapel)

This impacts all domestic hot and cold water and includes toilets. 
Following the shutdown, building occupants should NOT drink tap water. Fountains and bottle-filling stations will be closed and signage will direct people to other buildings. 
The reason for the drinking-water restriction is that testing will be undertaken to ensure that quality is back to standards following work. 
Toilets will remain accessible and sinks can be used for washing hands and dishes. Should occupants notice any discoloration, they should let a tap run until the water is clear again.
Noise levels and risk of delays
The nosiest period for the work is expected during the first two days of the project because of excavation. Weather-permitting, this should be on October 24 and October 25.
In the case of equipment or weather-related delays, the project may be extended beyond the scheduled two-week period.

Facilities Management is undertaking major work on the entrances to the John Molson Building (MB). The doors need to be replaced and the entrance structure adapted.
Until late summer, enter south or via the tunnel
During the week of May 2, construction will begin on the north doors. A safety perimeter will be in place so occupants and visitors must use the southern entrance, located near the alleyway, towards Ste-Catherine Street. They are also encouraged to use the tunnel from EV, notably if coming from the metro.
This phase of work is expected to last until the end of August 2022.
During the fall term, entre via the new, north doors
Once the north entrance reopens, work will shift to the south doors. In September 2022, those arriving to the MB from Ste-Catherine will need to continue north towards de Maisonneuve and entre via the new doors or access the building through the EV tunnel.
During the work, Facilities Management will seek to reduce inconveniences incurred by the community. Still, if there are issues, people can contact the facilities Service Desk or Campus Security, if they require immediate assistance: 514-848-3717.

Durant la semaine du 2 mai, les travaux commenceront aux portes situées côté nord. Comme un périmètre de sécurité sera mis en place, les occupants et les visiteurs devront utiliser l’entrée sud, située près de la ruelle en direction de la rue Sainte-Catherine. Ils pourront également utiliser le tunnel du pavillon EV, notamment s’ils arrivent du métro.
Cette phase de travaux devrait durer jusqu’à la fin août 2022.

Quand l’entrée nord rouvrira, les travaux débuteront aux portes situées côté sud. En septembre 2022, les personnes qui arrivent au pavillon MB par la rue Sainte-Catherine devront continuer à marcher vers le nord jusqu’au boulevard De Maisonneuve et entrer par les nouvelles portes, ou accéder à l’édifice par le tunnel du pavillon EV.
Durant les travaux, le Service de gestion immobilière s’efforcera de réduire les inconvénients causés à la communauté. Les personnes qui éprouvent des difficultés peuvent toutefois communiquer avec le Service d’assistance de la Gestion immobilière ou, si elles nécessitent une aide immédiate, appeler le Service de sécurité au 514 848-3717.

Le pavillon Henry-F.-Hall sera fermé durant une partie du long week-end. De 11 heures le 14 avril à 9 heures le 17 avril, seul le personnel autorisé pourra accéder au pavillon en raison de travaux de ventilation.
Dès 9 heures le 17 avril, le pavillon rouvrira ses portes aux membres de l’effectif étudiant, du personnel et du corps professoral possédant une carte d’identité valide de Concordia. Comme il s’agit d’une période de congé, le pavillon ne sera pas accessible au grand public. Pour en savoir plus, consultez la page Web sur le calendrier des congés et jours de fermeture de l’Université.
Aucun accès aux toilettes du pavillon Hall durant le congé
Comme le Service de gestion immobilière utilisera également la période de congé pour entreprendre des travaux de plomberie dans l’édifice, tous les éviers et toilettes seront hors d’usage. Les personnes souhaitant utiliser les toilettes devront se rendre aux autres pavillons du campus Sir-George-Williams, dont le pavillon John-W.-McConnell (LB), situé du côté sud du boulevard De Maisonneuve.
En raison de la coupure d’eau, les laboratoires de travaux pratiques du pavillon Hall seront aussi fermés. Ils devraient rouvrir le lundi 18 avril à 15 heures.
Pour toute question ou préoccupation, écrivez au Service de gestion immobilière. En cas d’urgence, appelez le Service de sécurité au 514 848-3717.

The Henry F. Hall Building will be closed for part of the long weekend. From 11 p.m. on April 14 to until 9 a.m. on April 18 only authorized staff will be allowed to access the building due to ventilation work. 
At 9 a.m., April 18, the building will reopen to students, staff and faculty with a valid Concordia I.D. Because of the holiday period, the building will not be accessible to the general public. For details, please see the Holiday Schedule webpage.

Because Facilities Management will also be using the holiday period to undertake building-wide plumbing work, all sinks and toilets will be unavailable. Those looking for a washroom will need to go to other Sir George William buildings, including the Library Building (LB), located on the southern side of de Maisonneuve.
The shutdown of water also means that wet labs in the Hall will be closed. They are expected to reopen Monday, April 18 at 3 p.m.

Version française
Concordia’s Hall Building on the Sir George Williams Campus will have restricted access for two and a half days, beginning on Thursday, March 3, at 11 p.m. Only those needing access to their lockers, offices or labs will be allowed to enter.
The access restriction is due to building-wide plumbing work. All toilets, water fountains, sinks and related lab equipment will be without water.
As soon as the work is complete and systems have been tested and flushed, the Hall Building will reopen with regular access. Estimated reopening is Sunday, March 6, at 1 p.m.
During this timeframe, those who require access can:

go to the Bishop Street door of the Hall Building;
ring the buzzer for Campus Security; and
show agents a valid piece of Concordia ID.

To the users and occupants of the SGW campus, 
Please be advised that starting today, the demolition of the building in between the GM and LB buildings—1500 Boulevard De Maisonneuve Ouest—has begun. The demolition is expected to last two months. Following the demolition, the construction of a new twenty-storey apartment building is planned over the course of two years.
During the construction, pedestrian access on De Maisonneuve Street will be maintained, however the alleyway north of the GM garage will be closed for the duration of the project. To access the GM garage and the GM and EV loading docks, please use MacKay Street. We expect this construction to create noise, dust and an increase in deliveries to the site via de Maisonneuve Street. During deliveries, increased safety officers will be on site to direct circulation.
Although this project is not related to Concordia University, Facilities Management has established a communication channel with the builders and owners in order to minimize these impacts where possible.  As such, should you wish to inform us of disturbances due to the construction, please email call2400@concordia.ca or call ext. 2400.
